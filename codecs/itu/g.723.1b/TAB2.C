**  Table Structure:
**      The unquantized LSP vector, quantized LSP vector, and residual
**      LSP error vector are each divided into three subvectors.
**              The table format is as follows:

**      2nd pair corresponds to subvector 1
**      3rd pair corresponds to subvector 2
**
**      The 1st slot in each pair is used to index the location of
**      the vector in a 10-element array.  For example, for subvector
**      1, dimensions [0,..,2] get automatically mapped to array
**      location [3,..,5], and for subvector 3, dimensions
**      [0,..,3] automatically get mapped to array location [6,..,9].
**
**      The 2nd slot in each pair corresponds to the dimension of

/*
**  AcbkGainTable170:
**
**  Purpose:
**      Used to calculate the error expression in pitch prediction
**      optimization (also expressed as an adaptive codebook approach)
**
**  Table Structure:
**      The table is structured as 170 20-element vectors.  These
**      vectors are structured as precalculated values in the error
**      expression for the pitch
**      predictor.  Gi is the gain value multiplying the signal
**      delayed by a pitch period (+/- offset).  In equation 41.2,
**      Gi would be equivalent to bij.
**
**      1st 5 elements:   G1  G2  G3  G4  G5 in Q14
**      2nd 5 elements:  -G1^2  -G2^2  -G3^2  -G4^2  -G5^2
**      Next 10 elements: These are the off-diagonal elements
**           -G1*G2  -G1*G3  -G2*G3  -G1*G4  -G2*G4
**           -G3*G4  -G1*G5  -G2*G5  -G3*G5  -G4*G5

**
**  Table Structure:
**      The table is indexed by the index into the AcbkGainTable170
**      table (determined in Find_Acbk). The value, 60, is used only
**      as a place holder. They correspond to zeros in the gain170
**      table, which is the coefficient of the 1 tap long term
**      preditor (LTP).  The rest of the values range from -2 to +2.
**      These values pick one vector among the 5 vectors centered one
**      pitch period behind the current vector. (In contrast, the 5
**      tap LTP uses all five vectors centered one pitch period back.)
